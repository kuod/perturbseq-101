# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**perturb-101** is a tutorial curriculum repository with two series:
1. **`perturb_seq/`** — sequential end-to-end Perturb-seq analysis (CRISPR + scRNA-seq)
2. **`theis_ecosystem/`** — hands-on refresher for the full scverse / Theis lab tool stack

Pure documentation/tutorial project; no software package or build system.

## Environment Setup

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate perturb-101
jupyter lab
```

There are no build, test, or lint commands — each notebook is self-contained and run interactively in JupyterLab.

Perturb-seq notebooks must run in order; 03 downloads raw data to `../data/` (git-ignored). Notebooks 08 and 09 can run in parallel after 07. All intermediate `.h5ad` files land in `data/` at repo root.

## Key Architecture Decisions

**Data containers:** AnnData (`.h5ad`) for single-modality, MuData for multi-modal (GEX + guide matrices). Intermediate objects are written to `data/` between notebooks and not committed.

**Two primary datasets:**
- Norman et al. 2019 (*Science*): CRISPRa, K562, 236 perturbations, ~109k cells
- Replogle et al. 2022 (*Cell*): CRISPRi, K562, ~2,057 genes, ~650k cells

**Core analysis stack:** `scanpy` + `pertpy` (guide assignment, Mixscape, distances) + `pydeseq2` (pseudobulk DE) + `decoupler-py` (TF activity).

**Perturbation modalities covered:** CRISPRko (Cas9 indels), CRISPRi (dCas9-KRAB repression), CRISPRa (dCas9-VP64/SAM activation).

## Known Gaps (from 13_gap_analysis_and_roadmap.md)

- Guide UMI matrix in notebook 06 is simulated, not real Cell Ranger output
- Batch correction not covered (harmonypy/scvi-tools are commented out in environment.yml)
- SCEPTRE (rigorous permutation-based DE) not runnable from Python
- GEARS deep learning deferred (requires GPU); only a linear baseline is demonstrated
- Statistical power analysis absent
- Multiple testing correction across perturbations not addressed

## Supporting Reference Files (in `perturb_seq/`)

- **glossary.md** — Definitions for all domain-specific terms
- **tools_reference.md** — Pros/cons/differentiators for every tool across the pipeline
